## Requirements
    Case is VERY important here. This caused me issues:
        Djangorestframework>=3.12.2,<3.13.0 should have been djangorestframework>=3.12.2,<3.13.0

## Travis CI
    Sign in with GITHUB account (travis-ci.org soon to be travis-ci.com).

## GitHUB
    Use GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 to see what SSH is upto when something like "git push" does not work.
